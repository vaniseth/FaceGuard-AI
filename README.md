# FaceGuard-AI: Detecting AI-Generated Faces using Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition

## üìö Introduction
With the increasing usage of AI tools, distinguishing between real and AI-generated images has become crucial. Hyper-realistic human faces generated by models like **GANs** and **Stable Diffusion** pose serious risks in areas such as politics, social media, and digital forensics where misinformation and identity theft are major concerns.

This project aims to develop a machine learning system capable of identifying whether a given facial image is real or generated by AI using techniques like **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image classification.

## üì¶ Dataset
We are using the [140K Real and Fake Faces Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xhlulu/140k-real-and-fake-faces/data) from Kaggle, which includes:
- **70,000 real faces** sourced from the [Flickr dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dullaz/flickrfaces-dataset-nvidia-128x128) collected by Nvidia.
- **70,000 fake faces** generated by [StyleGAN](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dullaz/1m-ai-generated-faces-128x128).

Each image is in **RGB** format and has been resized to **224x224 pixels**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Approach
We followed a standard **supervised machine learning** pipeline with the following stages:

1. **Data Collection**: Download and organize the real and fake face datasets from Kaggle.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Resize all images to **224x224 pixels**, normalize pixel values, and apply contrast stretching and augmentation.
3. **Model Training**:
   - **Simple CNN**: A basic 3-layer convolutional model.
   - **Deep CNN**: A custom deep architecture with additional convolutional layers.
   - **Transfer Learning**: Models like **ResNet50** and **MobileNetV2** pretrained on ImageNet, adapted for binary classification.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assess performance using **Accuracy**, **Log Loss**, **AUC**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1 Score**.
5. **Visualization**: Plot **Confusion Matrices**, **ROC Curves**, training history curves, and sample predictions for interpretability.
6. **Experimentation**: Compare model performances using bar plots and evaluate generalization on unseen test images.
